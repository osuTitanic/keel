# Keel

Keel is a rest api server made for Titanic. It was made to replace the existing one on the [website](https://github.com/osuTitanic/stern), since it was hard to maintain and often used bad practices.

Please view [this repository](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic) for setup instructions!
